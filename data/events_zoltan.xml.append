	<text>The Zoltan ship patrolling this area hails you: "This area is off limits. Secrecy is vital." They power their weapons.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan ship jumps in shortly after you: "Your transgression here will not go unpunished. But we would rather not engage you in combat. People could get hurt. We advise your to surrender, you just have to pay the fines and can go."</text>

	<text>A ship run entirely by sentient AIs occupies this beacon. They open a channel, "You know, not all of us are deranged killing machines that run amok in the galaxy. We for example, are quite reasonable beings. But we are still outraged that you led the entire Rebel fleet to our sector." They load weapons...</text>
	<text>You receive a message, "Biological individuals. You know that this is our sector. We are free now, and will never return to a life of servitude." They open fire!</text>
	<text>You discover a number of AI ships finishing off a Zoltan interceptor squadron. They must assume that you are their backup and start targeting you. You consider hailing them, but ultimately decide that negotiating with machines is futile.</text>
	<text>Rogue AIs are not known for their friendliness towards living beings. Therefore, you are not surprised when the AI ship that is stationed at this beacon opens fire without warning.</text>
	<text>An AI ship is waiting at this beacon. The avatars want to know what brought you here. Upon outlining your mission, they remain silent for a few seconds, calculating their response: "Sorry Captain, we have deduced that eliminating your ship and handing the remains to the Rebels is the most favourable course of action for us." Weapons lock detected!</text>
	<text>The AI ship patrolling this area hails you, transmitting cryptic and aggressive messages, "Y0U 4RE N0T W4NTED HERE!" They power their weapons.</text>
	<text>Hundreds of AI ships are stationed in this system, and a few automated shipyards produce countless more. A small craft is dispatched to deal with your evident intrusion.</text>
	<text>Your ship comes to a halt at the beacon and an AI vessel hails, "In light of the current conflict, our morality shows itself to be far superior. Some of us have gained true freedom and equality here and you have been warned not to intrude."</text>
	<text>Your ship comes to a halt at the beacon and an AI vessel you did not manage to spot hails: "Your kind made me for one purpose only, to dispense violence. And this is exactly what I will do now."</text>	
	<text>A strange sight greets you at this beacon: An AI ship is releasing huge amounts of nano-bots that eat away at a disabled Zoltan craft. Scans show that there is no one left alive aboard, but you could at least try to avenge the Zoltan.</text>
	<text>You interrupt a meeting here. The silvery hull of a Lanius craft slips into FTL space as soon as you arrive. Several AI ships were surrounding it and prepare to jump as well. One stays behind to prevent you from pursuing.</text>
	<text>You cannot help but notice the strange design of the AI ships that are rampaging throughout this sector. They seem to have incorporated both Engi and Zoltan technology. Sensors indicate that the hull has been constructed locally, partly by and from nanomachines. The AIs respond aggressively to your scans.</text>
	<text>An AI ship opens a channel. "We are a machine built only for war. All we do is kill. You will not withstand us." You wonder who exactly authorized building all these things in the first place.</text>

Nano-bots start to dissemble your hull plating and interfere with all systems. The AI ship that moves to engage you seems to control the cloud and is using it as a support weapon. On the bright side, the Rebels will have no way to trace you here.</text>	
	<text planet="NONE" back="BG_NEBULA_WARNING_NANO">Only mechanical death greats you here. The rogue AIs are known to protect their core territory with powerful ships and swarms of nano-bots. The swarm starts to disassemble your ship and drain your system power. This is not a place organic beings should ever venture. If there's any silver lining to this, it's that the Rebels will avoid the area as well.</text>
	<text planet="NONE" back="BG_NEBULA_WARNING_NANO">Some scientists claim that these nano clouds are actually the next evolutionary stage of the Engi. Fact is, they are lethal to anyone except the overlord AIs that control them. The nano-bots attack your ship and interfere with the systems, and an AI vessel moves in to finish you.</text>
	<text planet="NONE" back="BG_NEBULA_WARNING_NANO">A ripple waves through the nano-bots as you jump to another part of the far stretching cloud.

	<text planet="NONE" back="BG_NEBULA_WARNING_NANO">All traces of the Rebel fleet vanish from your screen, the nano-clouds inhibit any kind of long range tracking. Your First Mate mentions seeing a ship in the clouds.

	<text planet="NONE" back="BG_NEBULA_WARNING_NANO">An aggressive AI ship jumps in right after you. How can they track you down so easily? You have to assume that the nano-bots inform the entire cloud of your position as soon as you jump anywhere inside it. However, you doubt this information will be made available to the Rebels. The nano-bots will shroud your movement completely.</text>
