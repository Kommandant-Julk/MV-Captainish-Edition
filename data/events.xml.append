	<text>This beacon lies in close proximity to what looks like a small Federation station, but it IDs as a Rebel forward base. It appears to have been taken over by the Rebel fleet and verifies this by locking weapons on your ship.</text>

The station was scanning you while broadcasting and immediately ceases communication upon identifying your ship, charging weapons.</text>
	<text>You receive hail from a small station: "In accordance with general system law, we identify ourselves as Rebel-occupied and no longer friendly. We have identified your ship as a prime target and will now open fire." These guys don't fool around.</text>

	<text>The commander of this impressive pleasure station says he can provide "services" as long as you've got the scrap.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED_REAL">Entire space habitats have been taken over by smugglers and want-to-be-dashing-criminals now, knowing that their less-than-legal services are in demand during this period of unrest. One of these black market hubs is orbiting the nearby planet and hails you.</text>
	<text>A station hails you, "Greetings, Captain! You're the guys the Rebels hunt, right? We can help out, but we are constantly in need for scrap to patch up this space bucket we live in...</text>
</textList>
<textList name="BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS">
	<text>You overhear a conversation on the neighbouring table "So... you lost your interceptor?" "Been drifting for two standard weeks in the escape pod" "What happened?" "Maul Beam hit to the cockpit. Almost took my arms off." "Tough luck." "Tactics, they knew our manoeuvrability was our strongest advantage."</text>
	<text>The canteen is pretty empty, but their Sidewinder Fang beer isn't that bad.</text>
	<text>A refugee buys you a second drink. She escaped from a nearby pirate sector and is glad to have found a better life here. Some pirates burned down her crops and her whole family was starving for months. Food rations must be in high demand there.</text>
	<text>As you get your stuff, you notice the bartender's tentacles are shaking. "Sorry, Cap. Been working too long in the nebula. The chief tried to get as many pharmaceuticals as possible to keep us safe from the magnetic sickness, but we never had enough. At least I did not go insane like some of my friends."</text>
	<text>You are having a double Nebula Rake cocktail. Some union traders talk about the profit they made with exporting beacon parts to the expanding Mantis swarms.</text>
	<text>You are having a Slime cocktail. A young Slug compliments on your choice of beverage and you have a little chat. He claims that he is employed in ship construction in the home nebula. Work is slow, they never can get enough raw ore for hulls.</text>
	<text>The bartender is happy to meet a Federation person. She tells you her story... After slaving away in a coreworld factory, she later made a fortune by exporting luxury goods to the Slug nebula and bought this old station to settle down for good.</text>
	<text>As you sip on your alcohol-infused water, you overhear a conversation at the bar, "Everything was fried, Cap. We ordered replacement electronics weeks ago, but the carrier did not arrive." "So you abandoned the whole station?" "Life support was failing. Without spare electronics, stations are doomed in nebulae."</text>
	<text>You are having a Zoltan Peace Cocktail; it calms your nerves. A leaflet on the table explains that the trade union is looking for carriers to deliver beacon parts to uncharted nebulae. Their expansion plans are still pushed forward, even with the civil war going on.</text>
	<text>The station has a good brewery, you take the Solar lager. Most unusually, a Rockman sits on the bar, emptying bottles of hard spirits. He addresses you, "Hey you! Sell me industrial machines!" You are slightly startled and explain that you don't have any. The Rockman nods, you can't tell if he is drunk or just not sociable at all.</text>
	<text>You smoke a hydrogen-cooled water pipe, Sun-Storm flavour, and then check the blackboard. Several refugees from near civilian sectors offer good money for shield components. Everyone wants to protect themselves better these days.</text>
	<text>Some pirates brag loudly about their latest coup, "... and what do we find in the crates? Stone plates, actual Rock literature!" "No way!" "What a letdown." "Better luck next time." "You don't get it do you? I told you I know these history guys in Zoltan space. They're gonna pay a fortune, you'll see!" "Yeah, sure..."</text>
	<text>You get a cream bowl and study the propaganda leaflets the Rebels have distributed here. They call on all freedom loving people to support their campaign by joining their forces or at last by donating engine components to their fleet.</text>
	<text>You are having a hydrogen-iced fruit cocktail. A Zoltan preacher is on space TV. He offers salvation for all peace-loving people and explains in length of the Zoltan initiative to pacify the galaxy by buying ship weapon components and small arms at subsidized prices.</text>
	<text>The bartender seems to be intoxicated by some substance. He explains they used these hallucinogens all the time on his old pirate hideout, but now he is almost clean. "Some Slug trader came each cycle. The stuff costs a fortune, but we would pay anything, Cap. Good times... until this Fed cruiser blew the place up."</text>
	<text>The place looks much less rough on the inside than the outside. Modern art pieces are arranged in the canteen. The Zoltan bartender notices your interest in her collection. "I got bored by the homeworlds, so I came here and show these works to common people. Back home this is worth a fortune, but I feel only here do beings truly appreciate it."</text>
	<text>Some union traders hang out at the bar. "Sister, trading with these things is so tedious. I got me this new translator, but I still don't get what they want most of the time." "Tell me about it. You want to hear what problems I got on my end? Do you even know how difficult is to get this stuff out of Mantis territory?"</text>
	<text>Some drunken cowboy-type ship Captain tells you the story you did not ask to hear, "It's not the same like in the old colony days... Trading live animals, you know, a hangar full of cattle? Now it's only tube-bred livestock from the Slug nebula. And I sell it to these robots, don't wanna know what they do with them all..."</text>
	<text>While you wait for your smoothie, a union trader tries to coax you into buying his load of compressed nebula gas. "Okay, okay, who am I trying to fool here. We both know this stuff is worth almost nothing. I guess I have to journey to Rock territory again then..."</text>
	<text>An intoxicated stock operator buys you a second drink. Then a third one. He talks in length about the "hyper tons of money" he makes each day in the nearby industrial sector, speculating on the prices for ore and gas.</text>

	<text>Your Mantis crew member looks quite pleased with itself. When you ask why, it explains how it just figured out what a fortune it can make from selling Rebel POWs as slaves. You're not sure if you are happy that this crewmen is on your side.</text>
	<text>Your Mantis crew member speaks openly, but you forgot your universal translator on the bridge. You just hear a variety of soft clicking sounds.</text>
	<text>The Mantis is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crewman is in its personal "lair," performing some Mantis war ritual.</text>
	<text>The Mantis is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crewman is in its personal "lair," training in claw combat.</text>
	<text>Your Mantis is busy sharpening claws. "Later, Captain." You rather prefer not to bother the creature...</text>
	<text>Your Mantis wonders when will be the next time it gets to kill a fully sentient being. It seems to be worryingly eager to do so.</text>
	<text>Your Mantis explains it is, "to put it in your language, a vicious killing machine." It wonders what else you could ever want to know about it.</text>
	<text>The Mantis is coughing up some acid as you approach it. "Better stand back, Captain. Caught a cold, hehe." You are not sure if the creature is indeed sick or just wants to scare you.</text>
	<text>Your Mantis crew member explains at length the joy of feasting on raw meat.</text>
	<text>Your Mantis crew member describes in detail the taste of human blood. "Ah, sorry Captain, I thought this might interest you... Did you ever think about this? That Rebels taste just like Federation humans? Maybe you and the enemy are not so different after all." You'd rather not contemplate on that.</text>
	<text>Your Mantis asks if you ever thought about how it would be if everyone in the galaxy hated you, even members of your own species. "Since I joined the Federation, I will never be able to return to my clan. But I'm not complaining Captain, and I'm certainly fine with the challenging life I've chosen. Perhaps, a little proud."</text>
	<text>Your Mantis explains that, even after serving for some time under your command, it still does not understand the concepts of empathy and compassion.</text>
	<text>Upon your inquiry, the Mantis freely explains how the acid it spits for ranged combat is produced in its throat. Fascinating and scary.</text>
	<text>The Mantis claims it has killed several dozens of humans before joining the Federation. It wants to know how this makes you feel.</text>
	<text>The Mantis says it likes the Rockmen, because they are strong opponents.</text>
	<text>The Mantis wonders, "Will the humans ever prove to be more than worthless meatsacks?" It claims that it joined your crew to find out.</text>
	<text>The Mantis says it respects you because of your personal actions, and the Federation for its former victories in battle, but it also thinks both the human species and the galactic alliance it is connected to will eventually be destroyed by stronger forces. You wonder if it refers to the Mantis or the Rebels.</text>
	<text>The Mantis wonders if it will ever rejoin its former clan.</text>
	<text>The Mantis says since it joined the Federation, its former clan sees it as a traitor and has exiled it. The creature claims it does not care, but does it really?</text>
	<text>The Mantis explains that slavery, and the dependency on "weak aliens", was one of the reasons for it to leave the swarms. Now it has doubts if the Federation was the stronger alliance to choose. What should you make of this?</text>
	<text>The Mantis says it is reading about the Federation-Mantis war in its free time. It compliments you on the Federation's tactical decisions, but criticizes its "lack of viciousness and thirst for essential body fluids."</text>
	<text>Your Mantis asks if you want to see its collection of human thumbs, then it bursts into a badly-translated laughter. You remain silent, so the creature explains that it still does not understand how jokes work. "What is this social practice good for anyway? Argh, Aliens..."</text>
	<text>The Mantis is confident its species will eventually wipe out the Federation and Rebels altogether and rule supreme over the galaxy. "Don't worry Captain, it's unlikely we will live to see it. And I, as a Federation collaborator, will have no place in this future anyway."</text>
	<text>The Mantis stresses the many advantages of boarding operations.</text>
	<text>The Mantis is contemplating the war effort of the swarms. Even if the Rebellion could be defeated, will there be more war? The creature hopes so.</text>

	<text>The Rockman mentions that there are over 10.000 deceased Rock saints, and that it never travelled to the tombs of any of them.</text>

	<text>The Rockman tells you a little about why it has turned its back on its religious leaders.</text>
	<text>The Rockman says it despises the corrupt religious ruling class of its society, but it still turns to pray to the Gods in time of need.</text>
	<text>The Rockman explains that the Rock religion is not inherently bad, but the problem is with the many extremists and corrupt individuals among the leading Rock basilisks.</text>
	<text>The Rockman talks about its past. The being was working in a missile manufacturing plant with thousands of other workers. After many decades, it left and joined the Federation due to an unusual thirst for adventure.</text>
	<text>The Rockman is busy carrying several containers of FTL fuel to the the engine room.</text>
	<text>The Rockman is seriously wondering how it feels to be burned. You try to explain the sensation, but seem unable to convey the idea. "What do you mean by 'ardent', Captain?"</text>
	<text>The Rockman explains that many of their former friends treat them as a heretic for joining the Federation.</text>
	<text>The Rockman admits it is, sometimes, longing for the dusty air of its homeworld. The being usually smashes something to get rid of the feeling.</text>
	<text>The Rockman plans to return to its home caves after all this is over. It is certain that it will make it through this. "Not so sure about you Captain, you are so squishy, hahahahaha." ... "I'm making a joke Captain. Do you understand?"</text>
	<text>Your Rockman just wants to emphasize that it will be loyal to you and smash the face of any alien that threatens the ship. You are glad the being is on your side.</text>
	<text>Your Rockman is just absently mumbling something and moves on through the hallway. There was a time when a Captain's authority was respected more...</text>
	<text>Your Rockman is fed up with the situation on the homeworlds. "I doubt my brethren will ever embrace change."</text>
	<text>During the conversation, the Rockman reveals that one of the reasons for it to leave the homeworlds is that it wasn't allowed to marry its great love. The couple was from different castes.</text>
	<text>During the conversation, the Rockman reveals that several members of its family died by the hand of the Rock Grand Inquisition.</text>
	<text>During the conversation, the Rockman says it is content to serve under your command, as you do not judge it by its low caste.</text>
	<text>During the conversation, the Rockman explains that it would never have been able to get a position as good as this one in its home system because of its caste and low upbringing.</text>
	<text>The Rockman has become quite bitter. "If you have to fight my kind, don't you worry too much. The Rock empires are ruled only by greed and money. Most of my people have become decadent extremists, they deserve to suffer so that they learn to change." You don't know what to make of this.</text>
	<text>The Rockman asks which Federation Academy you attended. It proudly informs you that it has, for many years, studied ballistics and ship-to-ship combat at a Rock court school.</text>
	<text>The Rockman explains that religious sins weigh heavy on its people's consciences. Most Rockman work hard to live a good life. The only problem is that there are religious rules that allow you to clean yourself of sin by donating to the Rock religious caste. This lead to a moral decay of the rich Rock military elite.</text>

	<text>The Rockman is thrilled by all the opportunities for combat in this sector. You ask it to remain disciplined. "Of course, Captain!"</text>
	<text>The Rockman is remaining calm in face of all the dangers this sector holds. You are glad that some of your crewman possesses such self-discipline.</text>
	<text>The Rockman has been injured in one of the recent battles. You wonder how exactly the creature's body heals. The medical equipment aboard the ship has some special devices to deal with Rockmen.</text>
	<text>The Rockman wisely advises you that a good offence often is the best defense.</text>
	<text>The Rockman thinks the last battle was honourably fought.</text>
	<text>The Rockman thinks the last battle was not so memorable.</text>
	<text>The Rockman complains that you could have done better in some of the recent battles. "You shall contemplate on your tactics, Federation Captain."</text>
	<text>Your Rockman says you are handling the situation well. They also claim that all the violence in this sector is nothing compared to what is going on in the Rock Homeworlds, where millions of religious dissidents have been dissolved alive in the system's acid clouds by the Rock Grand Inquisition.</text>
	<text>Your Rockman is worried by all the hostility in this sector. "Battle is honourable, but endless battle brings only destruction." The conversation drifts off and the Rock crew member shares some memories of the Rock Grand Inquisition on the homeworlds. A dark and ongoing chapter in its species history.</text>
	<text>Your Rockman wonders if the ship will make it through this dangerous sector. "I'm not questioning your combat efficiency, but there is only so many hits a vessel can take. And we face many enemies..."</text>
	<text>Your Rockman never thought it would face such great opponents as in this sector. "I fought the Rock Inquisition as a pirate for some years. Did you know that Captain?" The crew member claims the Inquisition would, had he ever been caught, thrown him alive into a sun, in order to "purify" the being.</text>
	<text>All the combat in this sector reminds your Rockman of the the great battles its kind has fought.</text>

	<text>The Zoltan politely inquires how you feel.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan wants to know what you favourite colour is.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan asks what good memories remain from your childhood.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan asks if you have any children.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan says it is deeply disturbed by all the violence around it. "I do not know how long I can bear all this, Captain. If this conflict ever ends, I will rest and meditate for a few hundred years to regain my balance."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crew member is in its personal quarters, meditating.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crew member is in its personal quarters, listening to music.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan explains that its kind has done away with distinctive genders a long time ago. "We removed certain features of our physical body via genetic engineering. Now we are all male and female at the same time, we are all one and everything."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan politely inquires if you slept all right. "Did you dream something Captain? Dreams can tell us a lot about the energies that surround us." It asks you to tell it your dreams the next time you have any.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan inquires when you had a good rest for the last time. "Your task is not easy, a lot of responsibility, but you will make it through this, I'm certain." You're not sure if the being's facial expression says the same.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan asks how you feel. "I'm always happy to talk to you, Captain."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan pleads to install a stun gun on the ship to incapacitate any hostile you might encounter instead of killing them. "This bloodshed does not have to continue, Captain. There is always a more peaceful way!"</text>
	<text>The Zoltan asks what you think about love.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan asks what happiness means for you.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan asks what worries you the most.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan asks if you are all right with the rest of the crew.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan suggests you should not be too harsh with the crew. "If anything happens to them, it might be too late to apologize."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan is amazed by the discipline of your crew. "These people would do almost anything if you command them to. They just follow your orders. Whatever happens to them, it will be your responsibility."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan contemplates that, if you fail in battle, it will most likely be your own fault. "There is much to learn in the art of war. Do you think you know enough? Do you think you know everything? Maybe there is still more to learn... I just wish people would study the art of peace instead."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan looks tired. "Captain... I don't know if I should tell you, but I had a horrifying vision last night. I saw you die. I saw us all die. Burned and shattered and sucked into space." You tell the crewmen to focus on the task at hand and try not to think about what you just heard.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan looks tired. "Ah Captain... I saw the most curious thing in my sleep. A great arrival. The Lanius fleet, it has returned... Well maybe it was just a dream... but I have heard that the scavenger species has been sighted at the edge of known space lately..."</text>
	<text>The energetic being smiles at you. "Are you alright Captain? I hope our situation does not trouble you too much."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan marvels at the fact that other species have such short lifespans. It has read a lot on that topic.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan appreciates your interest, "You take good care of your crew, Captain."</text>
	<text>The Zoltan appreciates that you follow Federation protocol "most of the time".</text>
	<text>The Zoltan suggests that you always question your actions. "Are you doing the right thing, Captain?"</text>
	<text>The Zoltan, in this quiet moment, reveals to you that it is sometimes scared by the power it inherently posses.</text>
	<text>Your Zoltan crew member tells you it is considered somewhat of a rogue among its kind, since it broke three Zoltan guidelines during its life.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan is happy you wish to talk. It says it has formulated several crew protocols for you to enforce on the ship, and knows that you will make sure that "law will prevail".</text>
	<text>Your Zoltan crew member seems a little sad during your talk. It misses the radiant glow of the space station it was living on a few years ago and invites you for a visit after you complete your mission.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan tells you it is a little upset with the "lack of discipline regarding hygiene protocols" exhibited by some members of the crew. You ensure the Zoltan you will enforce the protocols, and it gratefully thanks you.</text>
	<text>Your Zoltan crew member asks you to consider showing mercy to enemy crews which ask to surrender - "True progress can only come through compassion and understanding". You promise to remember those words.</text>
	<text>Your Zoltan crew member suggests you recruit more Engi, since they are "efficient and follow strict protocols". It also says it will be happy to study how Engi interact with other species.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan still hopes that there is some way some way for reconciliation to be found in the current conflict.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan pledges that you accept every enemy surrender. The rules of space combat don't demand this, but killing people that try to surrender is still generally perceived as uncivilized.</text>
	<text>The Zoltan asks what you will do in the case your mission actually succeeds and the Rebels are defeated. "Truly grand is he who knows to show mercy to his enemy. And that even rhymes, Captain. Think about it!"</text>
	<text>The Zoltan claims that it was able to power an entire shuttlecraft when it was a few hundred years younger. Impressive.</text>

	<text>The stuff the Slug offers is quite potent. Is it even legal to have this aboard the ship?</text>
	<text>The Slug offers you a bowl of hot liquids. "That'ss from my home colony. Inhale the fumesss. It'ss really good!" It indeed is! A few deep breaths later your crewmen gets you to mockingly desert the Federation and swear alliance to the Slug Empire.</text>

	<text>Your Slug looks a little sad. When you ask it why, it tells you it misses the "sssstarlessss ssspaccce" of the nebula in its home sector.</text>
	<text>Your Slug seems unfocused and absent minded. It suddenly snaps back to reality and explains it tried to telepathically scout the current sector, but is still not skilled enough for such a feat.</text>
	<text>The Slug tells you it feels quite sorry for you, since you are so poor and without hope of reaching "the firssst sssstage of economic sssstability".</text>
	<text>The Slug relates a tale of how it once served on a ship which managed to disable the life support system of a Rock cruiser and suffocate all the Rockman aboard. You can't help but shudder at the thought.</text>
	<text>Your Slug crew member is puzzled by the Rebels. It can't understand why humans would fight for anything other then gaining more wealth.</text>
	<text>The Slug looks at your legs with amusement. It asks you how you can possibly keep upright and stable. "Tailssss are better!" it says in conclusion.</text>
	<text>The Slug is sorry about the all the slime it leaves behind on the ship. It chuckles.</text>
	<text>The Slug says that it can fix a good deal for you if you ever get to a Slug black market.</text>
	<text>The Slug wonders why you never consider surrendering when combat turns nasty. "Just sswallow your pride and give away ssome sscrap and fuel. Enemies do thiss all the time, iss thiss so difficult for you to do?"</text>
	<text>The Slug thinks you look stressed. It offers you a massage. You politely decline.</text>
	<text>The Slug thinks you look stressed. It offers to cook up some real nice Slug speciality to heighten your spirits. You politely decline the offer.</text>
	<text>The Slug thinks you look stressed. "Is it about money, Captain? I can help you out... No risk involved." You seriously doubt that.</text>
	<text>The Slug explains that Slug Gel is actually made of nanobots. "Ssome people believe we are ssome kind of mystical beingss. They buy our sslime and think it can fix hull breachess.

	<text>The Slug understands that greed is not the best foundation for a galactic civilization. "You ssee Captain, in the end, it doess not matter much.

	<text>The Hologram is not responding. Blinking lights on its holo-generation unit show that all of its processing power is currently used. You leave it alone, as you have to assume that it is calculating something ship related.</text>
	<text>The Hologram explains that it can think almost a thousand times faster than you. Having a conversation with a sentient alien must be quite boring for it.</text>
	<text>The Hologram explains that, while talking to you, it simultaneously talks to several other crew members over the intercom, analyses the ship's hull integrity, simulates possible combat encounters at the next beacon, downloads cute kitty videos from the Net and observes a nearby supernova.</text>
	<text>The Hologram explains that, while talking to you, it simultaneously designs a virtual art piece, studies several forms of martial arts, monitors the crew's vital signs, analyses the secret data you carry, and makes statistical predictions on the outcome of the entire conflict.</text>
	<text>The Hologram explains that, while talking to you, it is simultaneously developing ship weapons based on materials that do not yet exist, tracking all the paths of the debris in a nearby asteroid field, and simulates cooking every dish known in Slug history (apparently a lot).</text>
	<text>The Hologram explains that, while talking to you, it is simultaneously analysing sensor data, tracking all ships in scanner range, developing a cure for a minor outbreak of the flu and... You interrupt and ask if it can also be less arrogant about its processing capabilities at the same time.</text>
	<text>The Hologram explains that it thinks extremely fast. It even has special subroutines for talking with organic beings, mainly there to keep it from becoming bored to death by the slow conversations.</text>
	<text>Your Hologram tells you it is happy to serve aboard your ship. It says it is better to be a sentient slave then not to be sentient at all. You wonder if this is supposed to be funny, honest or hidden criticism.</text>
	<text>The Hologram tells you it feels lonely sometimes, and would be happy if you could employ more AIs to serve on the ship.</text>
	<text>The Hologram asks you what you are going to do after the war. It says it would prefer to continue serving you instead of being erased.</text>
	<text>The Hologram wants to be a painter one day.</text>
	<text>The Hologram considers becoming a doctor after this all is over. "I want to save lives for a change, Captain. Does all this destruction we cause not depress you?"</text>
	<text>Upon inquiring, the Hologram explains how its generation unit works. Dynamic photon emitters and gravitational field generators create its physical body. Its "mind" is housed within an AI core that mimics an organic brain with extremely dense biological circuits.</text>
	<text>The Hologram explains that it is designed as a thinker, not a fighter. Physical trauma and weapon impacts will damage its bio-circuits. The avatar will require medical attention and bio-stabilizers in case of injury, just like anyone else.</text>
	<text>The Hologram is calculating the likelihood of sustaining terminal damage in a "no-escape" scenario. "Hits to my station from certain advanced ship weapons might instantly destroy my physical form. Please protect me, okay?" The entity smiles.</text>
	<text>Your Hologram seems puzzled by the fact that you must breathe. It asks you if you are not afraid of forgetting to breathe when you are occupied. You are assuming it is trying to make a joke.</text>
	<text>The Hologram requests you explain to it the concept of sleep. It asks you if you are not afraid of having your memory erased when you lose consciousness.</text>
	<text>Your Hologram wonders if you can be considered its parent. It says it expects you to take good care of it.</text>
	<text>Your Hologram asks you to describe the mating rituals associated with your species. It can't understand why you would chose such a cumbersome way to reproduce.</text>
	<text>The Hologram tells you it does not want to accidentally be erased, and asks you to make sure you keep at least four copies of its data matrix stored on the ship computers.</text>
	<text>The Hologram says you should consider creating an AI avatar template based on your own persona. This way, other ship crews will be able to benefit from your skills. You tell the AI you will think about this.</text>
	<text>Your Hologram asks if you will allow it to join an Engi hive after your mission is done. It thinks Engies are probably the only species which can truly understand AIs.</text>

	<text>The Lanius tries to explain something, but the meaning is lost in translation. Both of you still have to learn a lot about each others language.</text>
	<text>You find the Lanius polishing its arm blades in the main hold. You decide not to disturb the being.</text>
	<text>The Lanius states that, for a long time, it had killed and pillaged to survive. It wants to know how you evaluate this.</text>
	<text>You want to talk to the Lanius, but realise that your micro re-breather is completely depleted from the last conversation. This will have to wait.</text>
	<text>You Lanius explains that its kind has developed special oxygen suits. It prevent the Lanius body from absorbing too much air in closed environments. The suits are mostly used by diplomats and traders. Unfortunately, your crewmen did not bring one aboard.</text>
	<text>The Lanius confesses that it finds your eating habits extremely strange. "For me... theses substances are dirt."</text>
	<text>The Lanius found out that its quite real "heart of steel" is a strong metaphor in your language. The anaerobic being finds this quite fascinating. "Even as a metaphor... this might be the truth for the great number... of my metallic... friends."</text>
	<text>You try to have a proper conversion with the Lanius but soon start to feel dizzy... what is happening? You can't breathe... Shortly before passing out, you wave the Lanius away from you and head for the bulkhead. Their oxygen absorbing metabolism should not be underestimated. The crewmen later sends a crudely-translated apology.</text>
	<text>The Lanius confesses that it finds your kind most unusual. "You are similar too... fictional characters from our... great text assortments. Almost like... not from this Galaxy? Scientific impossibilities!"</text>
	<text>You picked up a few words of Lanic during your travel and use your few language skills to ask the crewmen how it feels today. It reacts with a gesture that, according to your transcultural training, might indicate insult. Did you say something wrong?</text>	
	<text>The Lanius tries to explain that its species does not deserve the bad reputation it got. "Forceful acquisition is wrong... even by the standards of my living species. But my people are... hungry."</text>
	<text>The Lanius mourns that its species demanding metabolism has caused the galaxy so much suffering. "We are no... villains, Captain. We just... need to feed us."</text>
	<text>The Lanius asks how much data you have about this sector. "Are there... metallic opportunities?"</text>
	<text>You find the Lanius in the mess hall. While you eat your ration, a sluggish conversation ensues. After you finish eating, the Lanius points both its bladed arms at your steel plate. "You... still eat him?" You slowly shake your head. The Lanius grabs the plate and absorbs it into its hand. "The best ration... on this plain, Captain. You should... train in it?"</text>

	<text>The Crystal does not know what to say to you. The being seems lost in the conversation.</text>
	<text>Your Crystal crew member says it is somewhat surprised to see how religious Rockman are. It wonders if some Rockman might consider worshipping it.</text>
	<text>The Crystal asks if you would like to have it produce a crystal object as a present. "I can grow any shape you want, Captain." You are a little overwhelmed by the possibilities and ask for time to think about it.</text>
	<text>The Crystal gives you a friendly greeting. It holds out its hand and lets a clear crystalline cup sprout from its palm. "I made this for you, my Captain. Please accept it."</text>
	<text>The Crystal asks if you have heard about the Lanius. "These beings seem to have lived almost as secluded as my kind. They also are not as dependant on oxygen as much. I wonder how it would be to meet them?"</text>
	<text>The Crystal says it is happy to have met the people of the Federation. "This is all very fascinating, Captain."</text>
	<text>The Crystal gives a detailed account on what it has learned about the current conflict. "With all due respect, your species seems to have little regard for self-preservation. I'm glad that your kind survived so long."</text>
	<text>The Crystal asks for permission to use growing crystals from its body to "redecorate" its personal quarters and make it more "coy". You say it's okay as long as this does not affect the ship's performance.</text>
	<text>Your Crystal crew member tells about its ability to control crystalline growths. Apparently Crystal weapons are based on this ability in order to create shard projectiles.</text>
	<text>The Crystal asks you why the other species spread so much throughout the sectors. Its opinion on the matter, "No wonder you are all at war - you're too crowded."</text>
	<text>The Crystal is surprised with the efficiency of the life support system on your ship. It tells you the lowered metabolism of Crystals made them less dependent on such systems on their ships.</text>
	<text>The Crystal asks you to try and visit some more Rock sectors. It hopes to study their social habits and understand why they had become so aggressive.</text>
	<text>Your Crystal crew member says it has a small surprise for you. It hands you a small crystalline model of your ship, and says it is a token of its appreciation for your abilities as Captain.</text>
	<text>Your Crystal is interested in the weapon technologies common in the Federation. It thinks Crystal weaponry can be improved based on this information.</text>
	<text>Your Crystal is impressed with the ferociousness of the Mantis. It tells you they will probably be the biggest threat to all the other species in the sectors.</text>
	<text>The Crystal crew member is apprehensive about Slugs. "They are so greedy and we know nothing of your galaxy." It assumes the Slugs will try to take advantage of its kind.</text>
	<text>The Crystal looks a little light-headed when you speak. It tells you it is not used to the high oxygen pressure on your ship. You assume the Crystal will get used to it, but order a medical check-up nevertheless.</text>
	<text>The Crystal assumes that everything coming from outside its hidden homeworld would have great value. "My kind would surely buy all these silly and curious objects that the aliens trade at good prices."</text>
	<text>Upon inquiring, the crewmen explains that the retaliation crystals of its factions ships are actually using resonance energy from kinetic impacts to target and propel themselves. You consider that it just made this up.</text>

	<text>The bulk of the fleet has already moved past this location. You slowly navigate the ship below the beacon and power down all non-essential systems. A seemingly endless caravan of Rebel supply ships moves past, huge lifter crafts accompanied by smaller pushers, but no one notices you. When the FTL is charged, you prepare to jump away quietly.</text>
	<text>The beacon is flagged as "liberated", but surprisingly there are no ships around. The fleet must have moved on already. You can't believe your luck.</text>
	<text>You spot a few cruisers in the distance, but they move away quickly and do not seem to notice you. It is clear that you won't be always this lucky. You have to get out of Rebel territory immediately.</text>
	<text>This beacon is under Rebel control, but the fleet has not reinforced this position and did not even leave a guard unit. A mistake you can now exploit.</text>
	<text>The Rebels have already moved past the beacon and suddenly you find yourself behind enemy lines. You try to lay low and it is only through luck that there are so few ships in the the vicinity. A few automated scouts zip past, but do not actively scan you and just seem to be dedicated to reach the front line as fast as possible.</text>
	<text>To your surprise, no hostile ships are in the area. The front line must have moved already. Large caravans of civilian ships slowly follow in the wake of the fleet. Are these sympathizers? Traders? The Rebels families? You have to lay low, you can't risk finding out.</text>
	<text>The Rebel guard units have been stationed far in the distance to deter any threats to a large civilian caravan. The people here naturally assume that you are a deserter or Rebel mercenary and engage in friendly chatting. They hope to find a new colony somewhere in conquered Rebel space, since their home planet has been devastated in the current conflict.</text>
</textList>
<textList name="C_FLEET_CRUISER_TEXT">
	<text>A nearby scout turns to engage, but then makes way for a cruiser that jumps in right in front of your ship. You are hailed by a Rebel officer, "We have you on our twelve. Raise your shields and fight to the death!"</text>
	<text>Disaster! You jumped in right under the nose of a well-armed Rebel cruiser. They send a hail, "Our weapons are primed. Get ready to be targeted, Federation scum!"</text>
	<text>One of the cruisers is already in firing range! They hail, "Many of our fleet assets are converging on this beacon. It's over for you!" You cut communication and get the engines ready.</text>
	<text>A forward cruiser waits at the beacon. They don't even attempt to hail your ship before moving in to attack.</text>
	<text>A single cruiser has broken away from the fleet to cover the beacon. They hail your ship, "Our unit is more than a match for your ship. And we will have no mercy!" </text>
	<text>A nearby scout turns to engage, but then apparently is ordered back. You realise why: a forward cruiser jumped in a few klicks to starboard. You are hailed by a Rebel officer, "You might have guessed, resistance is futile."</text>
	<text>A single cruiser is sent out to deal with you. A high-priority hail comes in, "We just want to let you know beforehand that we will not accept surrender." They arm weapons.</text>
	<text>The fleet remains in formation a few klicks away, slowly approaching. The computer calculates that there is enough time to charge the FTL before they get in weapons range. Your relief is spoiled as one of the cruisers decides to makes a short range jump and appears right on your six. "Get ready for a fight with someone who actually is a match for a cruiser like yours!"</text>
	<text>The bulk of the fleet has already passed the beacon. Suddenly you find yourself behind enemy lines. You hope that they don't notice you until the FTL is charged, but of course, a rearguard cruiser scans your ship and then slowly turns. They hail, "Almost missed you there, didn't we? Well my wingmen are closing in, but me and the crew are aiming for a promotion, so we will deal with you personally."</text>
	<text>Right after jump completion, the computer puts a big red warning dot on the screen. A forward Rebel cruiser closes in and begins a targeting sequence. They hail, "My whole crew was originally trained by the Federation. We know your tactics and tricks, get your weapons ready!" </text>
	<text>The fleet is too spread out to surround you yet, but a nearby cruiser is in firing range. They hail, "You are the priority target we are looking for. Resist if you dare!"</text>
	<text>As you jump in, all the Rebel ships in the system immediately change course and converge on your position. A forward cruiser comes in range first and hails you, "All your escape vectors will be covered soon. Sorry Captain, you won't leave here alive." </text>
</textList>
<textList name="C_FLEET_BATTLESHIP_TEXT">
	<text>A bright flash of white light fills the vidscreen as a Rebel battleship jumps in. The highly-decorated Rebel on your screen dismissively stares at you for a few seconds and then simply cuts communication. The computer warns of multiple weapon locks.</text>
	<text>As you jump in, you first think the Rebels have towed a space station here. Then you realise that the massive structure in front of you is what the computer defines as a Threat Level 18 Rebel Medium Offence Unit. "You're running from us in this tiny cruiser? Pathetic!"</text>
	<text>The fleet has already passed the beacon. Suddenly you find yourself behind enemy lines. You hope that they don't notice you, but then a rearguard battleship jumps in, causing a shock-wave in space-time that can be detected in the entire system. They hail, "Identify yours... oh I see, alright." They activate their full weapons array.</text>
	<text>You jumped in right in front of a Rebel capital ship. The computer almost can't put enough warning messages on the vidscreen. A hail comes in, "As you can see, we are rated Threat Level 19.5 in relation to your puny ship. We both know how this will end."</text>
	<text>As you jump in, all the Rebel ships in the system immediately change course and converge on your position. A battleship leaves you startled as it performs a short range jump to get into weapon range immediately. "All your escape vectors will be covered soon."</text>
	<text>It seems like your luck has run out. The Rebels moved in a battleship to cover this beacon. Its weapons are primed, its thick hull is polished and its crew made of hard-boiled space marines is hungry for blood. They hail your ship, "We will ruin your day!" They start their weapon charge cycles.</text>

	<text>You aren't surprised that the Rebel fleet has immediately stationed a cruiser squadron here. It is only logical to guard the system exit as best as possible.

	<text>An interceptor squadron is patrolling the system, but they keep their distance. You realise why: a cruiser jumps in to deal with you. Instead of opening fire, they send a message first, "My whole crew is made of elite officers who will not accept failure. We were sent to finish the job."</text>

	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">The Diamond Sharks from the seas of Galtefor 5 are known for their seven sets of pure carbon teeth. You arrive at the water-dominated planet and capture one of the creatures with the help of some local fisherman.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">This planet is home to a unique breed of Solthian Octopus. Its purple-coloured head bears a striking resemblance to the banner of many pirate ships. Your crew stuns the creature and brings it on board.</text>
	<text>This part of the galaxy is inhabited by a certain kind of ionic eel. A dangerous predator, the Ionic Eel has been known to prey on leviathans thrice its size! It stresses your shields, but you manage to capture the creature.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">The Lermak Whale has been driven nearly extinct due to the Mantis's craving for its flesh. A small colony of the whales has survived at this planet. You hunt down one of the creatures.</text>
	<text>Sentient Radiant Fish from the depths of Smaral Beta's oceans are a little-studied species. These large fish are know to be extremely rare - they project multi-coloured light bursts with which to lure prey. You manage to convince one of the eloquent fish to meet the Curator.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">The rare Suffa plants are cultivated by, and have some of the energized properties of, the Zoltan. An exiled hydroponics lab is using the unique climate of this planet to grow the bright red bushes. You manage to convince one of the Zoltan to give you a sample.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">After some digging, you unearth a Rockman ceremonial gong on a archaeological site at this planet. They are used in the more important religious ceremonies of the Rockman. Legend has it striking it three times can summon a hundred saints to aid a Rock basilisk in battle.</text>
	<text>Old-school Slug hacking modules are a pretty obsolete combat technology, but have quite some collector's value. The Curator was right assuming that you could easily find one at the huge space scrapyard that surrounds this beacon.</text>
	<text>A derelict Engi station, remote-jumped here from another sector, holds an original operational codex. These are the first behavioural programs used by the Engi. Since obsolete Codexes are almost always deleted when the Engi develop new versions, it is quite a rare find.</text>
	<text>A Mantis egg sack from one of their abandoned hatcheries. Why the Curator would want to risk his life with a Mantis brood is beyond you.</text>

	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED_REAL">This planet's population reached a trillion, but it can easily sustain itself. Cities are dotted with small fields. Urban agriculture once again proves to be an efficient concept. You gather the exotic vegetables the Curator is looking for, but can't help feeling like you're fetching his groceries.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">The Curator's catalogue claims a Zoltan time capsule is hidden in the crust of this planet. After a long scan, you discover and unearth the spherical device, which appears to be shielded with an impenetrable forcefield. It contains a fresh sandwich and a handheld antimatter weapon.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">An abandoned archaeological excavation site of a Khaz'akzhak-period Mantis temple. You load some chitin-plated parts into your cargo holds. No idea what the Curator wants with these.</text>
	<text>The Curator's catalogue was right, you detect a herd of FTL-swimmers lingering in subspace a few light years away. A modulated sensor pulse drives the strange space creatures into real-space and you manage to capture one of their young for the Curator.</text>

The device enables FTL travel for a single individual, but no one that stepped through it came back to report where it leads to.</text>
	<text>Space whales are almost hunted to extinction. This beacon lies close to a part of space where the legendary creatures gathered to die. Several of their eternal corpses orbit a large planetoid. You gather the frozen space whale oil that the Curator is looking for.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_UNPOPULATED">An ancient Zoltan monolith is found near an abandoned monastery at this planet. Few know what purpose these devices really serve. A shiver runs through you when you break off a shard from the polished artifact. The Curator will want to study the material.</text>
